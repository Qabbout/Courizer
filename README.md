# Courizer

A Cross-platform Mobile Application that Organize your Courses' Images Automatically.

## The Idea

Remember all those times you took pictures of the board/notebook, and ended up losing them with the rest of your phone pictures?

Remember the need of creating all these albums and moving and renaming every picture every day?

Courizer is made to help you solve this problem in a single click, and More!

## Permissions

This application requires some permissions in order to work:

- Camera access (to take the pictures).
- Storage access (to create the folders and save the pictures)

### Disclaimer

The application is not released for iOS yet, I need an apple developer account for this :/.
